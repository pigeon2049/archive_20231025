James Gorman, Morgan Stanley CEO, July 18, 2023.

CNBC

[Morgan Stanley](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MS/) said Wednesday that [Ted Pick](https://www.morganstanley.com/about-us-governance/operating-committee/ted-pick) will succeed [James Gorman](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2017/01/19/james-gorman-4-percent-economic-growth-unlikely.html) as CEO at the start of 2024.

Pick, a Morgan Stanley veteran who rose through the ranks to lead the bank's Wall Street operations, will also join the New York-based bank's board, according to the [release](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231025233829/en/Morgan-Stanley-Announces-Ted-Pick-to-Become-Chief-Executive-Officer-on-January-1-2024-James-Gorman-to-Become-Executive-Chairman).

Gorman will stay on as executive chairman.

The announcement ends the top [succession race](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/19/morgan-stanley-ceo-succession-gorman-to-step-down-within-the-year.html) on Wall Street. Morgan Stanley announced in May that Gorman intended to step down within a year and that it would select his successor from one of the bank's three main division heads.

Pick, who was co-president of Morgan Stanley for the last two years, led the bank's institutional securities group, which includes investment banking and trading activities.

Among insiders, Pick has long been considered frontrunner for the CEO job because of the complexity and risks involved with leading one of Wall Street's top firms.

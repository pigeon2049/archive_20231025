Sudan's army said on Wednesday it had accepted an invitation for a delegation to travel to the Saudi Red Sea port of Jeddah to complete negotiations with the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) after six months of war.

The Jeddah talks aim to bring a pause, if not complete end, to fighting that broke out in April in a power struggle between the army and the RSF over terms for a gradual transition from military rule to democracy.

In July, an army delegation returned home for consultations and said it would resume talks aimed at restoring peace to Sudan in Jeddah "after obstacles are overcome".

The United States and Saudi Arabia, who sponsored the talks, suspended them soon afterward.

"Out of a belief by the armed forces that negotiations is one of the means that may end the conflict, we have accepted the invitation to travel to Jeddah to complete what was previously agreed upon," the army said in its statement.

However, it added, "the resumption of negotiations does not mean a halt of the national battle of dignity".

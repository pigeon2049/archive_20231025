U.S. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday the [Israel-Gaza crisis](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/world-leaders-seek-suspend-israel-hamas-fighting-gaza-aid-2023-10-24/) should have "a path to peace" including independent states for the Israelis and Palestinians and integrating Israel among its Arab neighbors.

Biden opened a [joint press conference](https://www.reuters.com/world/australia-us-leaders-discuss-pacific-infrastructure-critical-minerals-2023-10-24/) with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese by saying U.S. support for Israel's defense is ironclad, but the parties need to think about the way forward in the region once the Gaza crisis is resolved.

"Israelis and Palestinians equally deserve to live side by side in safety, dignity and in peace," said Biden.

Biden said he believed one reason Hamas militants attacked southern Israel, killing 1,400 people on Oct. 7, was to prevent normalizing relations between [Israel and Saudi Arabia](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-puts-israel-deal-ice-amid-war-engages-with-iran-sources-say-2023-10-13/). Israeli airstrikes in retaliation have [killed over 6,500 people](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gaza-families-wear-id-bracelets-avoid-burial-mass-graves-2023-10-25/), the health ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza said on Wednesday. Reuters has not been able to independently verify the casualty figures of either side.

Biden said he had "no notion" that the Palestinians were telling the truth about how many had been killed. "I'm sure innocents have been killed, and it's the price of waging a war."

 "I have no confidence in the number" that the Palestinians are using, he said.

Once the crisis is over, "there has to be a vision of what comes next" in the region, Biden said, a future that should include a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians.

"I continue to be alarmed about extremist settlers attacking Palestinians in the West Bank," Biden said, accusing them of pouring gasoline on a fire. "They're attacking Palestinians in places that they're entitled to be," he said.

AUSTRALIA OFFERS AID

Albanese, in his opening remarks, said Australia will provide an additional $15 million in aid for Gaza civilians.

Earlier, at a White House arrival ceremony, Albanese said "American leadership is indispensable, but it is not inevitable," he added. "It takes a leader to deliver it…it takes true leadership to seek peace, because protecting innocent people is not a show of weakness, it is a measure of strength."

A growing chorus of nations are pushing Israel to take a humanitarian pause in its attacks on Hamas in Gaza that have killed thousands of Palestinians, many of them children. Biden, a [self-described "Zionist"](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/i-am-zionist-how-joe-bidens-lifelong-bond-with-israel-shapes-war-policy-2023-10-21/), has strongly supported Israel following Hamas' Oct. 7 attack while cautioning the country to abide by democratic principles.

Australia is a key ally in the Pacific, and Biden scheduled the visit after [canceling a trip to Sydney](https://www.reuters.com/world/biden-facing-debt-ceiling-debate-could-skip-australia-part-asia-trip-2023-05-16/) in May to stay in Washington and negotiate a government funding crisis.

PHILIPPINES SUPPORT

Biden appeared to issue China a warning after a series of [maritime confrontations](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-says-it-lawfully-blocked-philippine-ships-going-disputed-shoal-2023-10-22/) with the Philippines, saying the United States' commitment to Manila's defense is iron clad.

China is having its own internal and external difficulties right now, Biden added.

The U.S.-Australia partnership is "an alliance that is marked by imagination, ingenuity and innovation," Biden told the prime minister in opening remarks upon his arrival at the U.S. presidential complex in Washington, citing their partnership on World War One, World War Two and the war on terror.

The visit is expected to result in agreements aimed at deterring and competing with China, even as separately the two countries try to thaw relations with Beijing. The two nations are committed to making sure the "Indopacific remains free, open, prosperous and secure," Biden said.

Albanese, greeted with a red carpet, military bands and a receiving line of Biden's top advisers, praised American democratic values and lauded Biden for maintaining "that every innocent life matters, Israeli and Palestinian, and that in every conflict every effort must be made to protect civilians."

He also pledged continued cooperation in Ukraine's ongoing fight against Russia's invasion last year.

The expected deals include launching an [undersea internet cable project](https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-run-internet-cables-pacific-islands-australia-us-deal-2023-10-25/) and maritime wharf infrastructure investment designed to benefit and woo Pacific Island nations whose assistance may be needed to respond to any future [conflict over Taiwan](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australians-say-they-would-support-taiwan-if-china-attacked-with-limits-poll-2023-06-20/) or the South China Sea, according to U.S. officials.

Washington and Canberra, already partners in a decades-old collective defense agreement, will also announce wider security cooperation with Japan.

The balancing act of strengthening deterrence against China without offending Beijing too much is made more complicated by a Middle East crisis that has again diverted Washington's attention away from the Indo-Pacific.

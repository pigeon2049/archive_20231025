China and the United States are two major nations and how they will get along with each other in future is crucial for the whole world, Chinese President Xi Jinping said. "As two major countries in the world, whether China and the United States can find a right way to get along with each other \[is key for\] world peace and development and the future of humanity," Xi said in letter to the participants of the annual gala dinner hosted by the National Committee on US-China Relations, as read by Chinese Ambassador to the US Xie Feng on Tuesday.

Approval of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's performance has fallen in the last two months as Brazilians worry that Latin America's largest economy is worsening, a new Genial/Quaest poll showed on Wednesday.

Approval of his way of governing has fallen to 54% in October from 60% in August, while 42% of those polled say he is doing a bad job, up from 35% in the previous survey.

Positive approval of his 10-month-old government has also slipped to 38% from 42% of respondents in August, and negative views rose 5 percentage points to 29%, the poll found.

The number of Brazilians who see the economy deteriorating has risen to 32% from 23% in August, as optimism dipped to 33%from 34% of those who see the economy improving.

Still, more Brazilians believe Lula is doing better than his far-right predecessor Jair Bolsonaro: 47% of those polled think his government is better than Bolsonaro's, down from 49% in August, and those that say his government is worse rose to 38% from 34% in two months.

Genial/Quaest interviewed 2,000 people of voting age between Oct. 19 and Oct. 22. The poll has a 2.2 percentage point error margin.

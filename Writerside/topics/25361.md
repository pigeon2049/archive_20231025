[Deutsche Bank](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DBK-FF/) on Wednesday reported a third-quarter net profit of 1.031 billion euros ($1.06 billion), slightly beating expectations despite an 8% fall on the previous year and ongoing struggles in the lender's investment unit.

Analysts had expected a quarterly net profit attributable to shareholders of 997 million euros, according to LSEG data.

Net profit was 35% higher on the prior quarter despite the year-on-year dip. It was Deutsche Bank's thirteenth straight profitable quarter since its [large-scale restructuring](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/07/deutsche-bank-will-exit-its-global-equities-business-and-scale-back-investment-bank.html) launched in 2019.

For the same period in 2022, the [German lender recorded a net profit of 1.115 billion euros](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/26/deutsche-bank-earnings-q3-2022.html) on the back of higher interest rates and increased market volatility that boosted its fixed income and currencies trading business.

The bank delivered a strong performance in its corporate banking business — which benefits from the higher interest rate environment — where revenues rose 21% year-on-year to 1.89 billion euros.

However, it [continued](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/26/deutsche-bank-beats-expectations-despite-27percent-drop-in-profit-jump-in-costs.html) to see a slowdown in its investment arm, where net revenues fell 4% year-on-year to 2.27 billion euros and are down 12% in the first nine months of the year to 7.3 billion.

Deutsche Bank CFO James von Moltke told CNBC's Silvia Amaro that the investment banking unit's performance is "pretty much in line with the market" on an underlying basis.

"What's going on is the normalization of fixed income and currency revenues that we called for, especially in the macro businesses, so rates, foreign exchange and emerging markets, which benefited last year from the very high levels of volatility," von Moltke said.

There has been a rotation of the bank's activity focusing onto other products, notably credit and financing, which have seen strength, he said.

The [S&P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX/) tumbled to its lowest since June on Wednesday after disappointing quarterly results from Google-parent [Alphabet](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/) and a rebound in interest rates.

The benchmark index fell 1.5%, breaching the key 4,200 level that was being widely watched by chart analysts. Stock losses accelerated during the session after the benchmark broke that level. The [Nasdaq Composite](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.IXIC/) lost 2.4%, while the [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DJI/) fell 104 points, or 0.3%.

The S&P 500 fell below a key 4,200 level on Wednesday.

[Alphabet](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/) shares tumbled more than 8% as its [cloud business missed analysts' estimates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/24/alphabet-googl-earnings-q3-2023.html), overshadowing its strong revenue growth and earnings beat. The decline in Alphabet stock is its worst fall since October 2022. The S&P 500 communication services sector shed 5.8%, on track for its worst day since February 2022.

Shares of peer tech behemoths and [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/) and [Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN/) meanwhile, slipped 1.3% and nearly 6%, respectively. Amazon is set to report third-quarter results after the closing bell on Thursday.

While corporate earnings maintain investor focus this week, investors also kept an eye on yields, as they hovered near multiyear highs. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbed 11 basis points to 4.954%. It traded above 5% earlier in the week, which rattled investors and hit tech shares.

"Earnings are dominating the headlines, but I can't take my eyes off the bond market," said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. "We haven't seen this skyrocketing pace in yields since 1982 and that should spell trouble for stocks."

[Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/) stood out as an outlier among the decline in tech stocks on Tuesday, with shares gaining 2.5% [after first-quarter results beat Wall Street estimates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/24/microsoft-msft-q1-earnings-report-2024.html).

Tech firms [IBM](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/IBM/) and [Meta](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/) will post quarterly results in the afternoon. About 29% of S&P 500 companies have posted third-quarter earnings thus far. Of those companies, 78% have exceeded expectations.

The Federal Reserve has tightened further than investors expect, Torsten Slok says
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Federal Reserve has tightened further than investors expect, according to Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management.

In fact, the economist expects the federal funds rate is actually 7%, not 5.5%, when accounting for the reduction in its balance sheet. The fed funds rate is set by the central bank and is the interest rate banks can charge for overnight loans.

"We never really had the balance sheet of forward guidance playing the major significant role that it does today," Slok said Wednesday on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street." "And when you quantify the impact, in particular, of running down the balance sheet as they're doing at the moment, they do find in their own calculations that the Fed funds rate today is not only 5.5%, but it's actually 7%."

"In other words, policy is a lot tighter than what they and we all think, simply because the other tools that they have are also helping in putting downward pressure on the economy," he said.

China signals more support for struggling local governments

China on Tuesday took steps toward [easing financing conditions for local governments](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/24/china-signals-more-support-for-struggling-local-governments.html), which have been at the crux of recent economic difficulties.

The central government said it formalized a process allowing local governments to borrow funds for the year ahead — starting in the preceding fourth quarter, according to an announcement published by state media.

On Tuesday, Chinese authorities also announced the issuance of 1 trillion yuan ($137 billion) in government bonds for natural disaster relief, according to state media. Xinhua, the official state news agency, also pointed out the deficit would increase to 3.8% from 3%.

Earlier on Tuesday, [Bloomberg reported, citing sources](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-24/xi-makes-unprecedented-pboc-visit-in-sign-of-focus-on-economy), that Chinese President Xi Jinping made his first known visit to the People's Bank of China since taking the top leadership role.

Government shutdown looms as Republican speaker search continues
----------------------------------------------------------------

Michael Townsend, managing director of legislative and regulatory affairs at Charles Schwab, said Tuesday that he wouldn't be surprised if the U.S. federal government shuts down next month, but that Wall Street would likely shrug it off like it has in prior years.

"I'm not really worried about how the market will react if we do have a shutdown," Townsend said at Schwab's Impact conference in Philadelphia.

Townsend's comments came shortly after Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota dropped his bid for [Speaker of the House](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/24/house-gop-speaker-vote.html). The continued failure to find a Speaker means that Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina could end up getting some temporary powers in order to help Congress operate, Townsend said.

The Schwab expert also said that the federal deficit is becoming a bigger factor in markets due to higher interest rates but that there is not urgency in Washington to address the budget shortfall in a significant way.

"The changes in spending that even Republicans are talking about are tiny drops in the bucket compared to these big issues," Townsend said.

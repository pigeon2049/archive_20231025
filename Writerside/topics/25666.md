thatDot is a company that aims to produce meaning from data and turn high-volume data into high-value data. They have developed a new technology that unifies storage and computational models for high-volume streaming enterprise data, allowing each piece of data to perform its own computation. This technology enables faster insight and understanding of large amounts of data, reducing the time it takes to test data hypotheses and add product features.

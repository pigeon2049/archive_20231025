Pope Francis on Wednesday renewed his calls for the release of hostages held by Palestinian militants and for humanitarian aid to be allowed into the Gaza Strip.

"I am always thinking about the grave situation in Palestine and Israel. I encourage the release of hostages and the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza," he said during his weekly audience.

Francis recalled that he will lead on Friday [special prayers for peace](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/pope-deplores-desperate-situation-gaza-2023-10-18/) in St. Peter's Basilica, in what he said last week would be a "a day of fasting, prayers, penance".

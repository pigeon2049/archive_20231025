X, the platform previously known as Twitter, is rolling out audio and video calls. [Several users](https://x.com/the_marcoli_boy/status/1717266451394888063?s=20) [on the](https://x.com/SharyOfficial/status/1717232523833495558?s=20) platform, including some of us here at _The Verge_, have received a notification when opening the app, stating: “Audio and video calls are here!”

There’s also a new “Enable audio and video calling” toggle within the app’s settings, which says you can “turn the feature on and then select who you’re comfortable using it with.” It includes options to allow audio and video calls from only people in your address book, people you follow, verified users, or all three. You can then [make a call](https://x.com/krassenstein/status/1717284421080940642?s=20) by opening a DM with another user, selecting the phone icon in the top right corner of the screen, and choosing audio or video call.

While X hasn’t officially announced its launch, the company appeared to tease it [with a cryptic post saying](https://x.com/X/status/1717239924603159010?s=20) “ready for it...?” shortly before it began appearing. X owner [Elon Musk has long hinted](https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/21/23472174/twitter-dms-encrypted-elon-musk-voice-video-calling) at adding audio and video calls to the platform as part of his [goals to make it the “everything app.”](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/26/23808796/elon-musks-x-everything-app-vision) Musk recently said the feature would be available on iOS, Android, Mac, and PC, with “no phone number needed.”

It’s still not clear how widely X has launched audio and video calls or if non-Premium users can use it. Last month, hashtag inventor and open-source advocate [Chris Messina found](https://www.threads.net/@chris/post/Cxd2ezwyRRn) that X’s code suggested that users would have to sign up for X’s Premium subscription to use it. X didn’t immediately respond to _The Verge_’s request for comment.

Musk also mentioned charging all users a yearly price to access the platform and has already started making users in [New Zealand and the Phillippines $1 per year](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/17/23921752/x-not-a-bot-charge-new-users-elon-musk).

Whether you want to keep tabs on trick-or-treaters or protect your holiday gifts from would-be porch pirates, a good video doorbell or security camera can come in handy during the holidays. Lucky for you, Amazon-owned Blink is offering up to 60 percent off a host of models as part of its Halloween sale, which runs through November 5th.

The sale spans a range of smart security products, including a [three-pack of Blink Mini cameras for $39.98 ($60 off)](https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-White-3Cam/dp/B08PBR83NM?tag=theverge02-20). If you’re looking for something to protect your porch, however, you can pick a [**Blink Video Doorbell**](https://www.theverge.com/22954554/best-video-doorbell-camera) with the **latest Blink Outdoor security camera** for just [$89.99 (half off) at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Video-Doorbell/dp/B0CKM795Z7?tag=theverge02-20). The retailer is also selling the Blink Outdoor 4 [for an all-time low of $71.99](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B1N5HW22?tag=theverge02-20) ($48 off) if you don’t need a video doorbell.

The battery-powered Blink Video Doorbell and Blink Outdoor 4 feature all the essentials you might want in a camera, including support for motion detection, night vision, and two-way audio. The latest Blink Outdoor security camera also offers a few perks the prior model lacks, including person detection and a wider field of view.

Of course, there are some tradeoffs given both models are budget-friendly picks. The Blink Video Doorbell only features 1080p video and offers few bells and whistles, for instance, meaning you’ll have to look elsewhere for things like smart alerts. You’ll also have to pay extra for some features (including cloud-based storage), but if all you need is a video doorbell or an outdoor camera that’s easy to set up and will last you a long time, you can’t go wrong with either of these two.

Alternatively, if you want a camera that can also scare away potential intruders with blinding lights and a siren, you can currently buy the **Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight Camera** — [our favorite battery-powered floodlight camera](https://www.theverge.com/22811985/best-smart-floodlight-security-camera) — [for $179.99 at Best Buy](https://howl.me/ckRkeeSy14S). That’s the best price we’ve seen on the camera in seven months and only $10 shy of its all-time low.

The terrific floodlight offers exceptional video quality and can capture and record in 2K. It can even pulse its light to scare off intruders and offers 2,000 lumens of brightness, or 3,000 lumens when plugged in. It’s also compatible with a range of smart home systems, including Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings, and Apple Home.

The Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight Camera has the best video quality, most versatile installation options, and widest smart home integration — Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings, and Apple Home. It’s expensive, though, especially when you add continual power and pay for smart alerts and video recording.

[$180 at Best Buy](https://howl.me/ckRkeeSy14S?u1=vergeroundupdeals102523)

If you’re on a tighter budget, the wired **Blink Floodlight Camera** is also on sale at [Amazon for $49.99 (half off)](https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Wired-Floodlight-Camera-White/dp/B0B5VLCL1N?tag=theverge02-20). We’re [still in the early stages of testing it](https://www.theverge.com/22811985/best-smart-floodlight-security-camera), but so far, we’ve found it to be a great budget option. It offers a nice design, lights that can get as bright as 2,600 lumens, and on-device processing of people alerts (if you opt for a Blink subscription plan). That said, its 1080p video quality isn’t as sharp as Arlo’s premium floodlight cam, nor does it work with any smart home platform other than Alexa.

We flagged **Anker’s PowerHouse 521** a few times over the summer, namely because it’s a great option for charging your various gadgets when you’re off the grid. However, even with our summer excursions behind us, we’d be remiss if we didn’t point out that the power station is currently [available at Amazon for a new low of $169.99](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FF46FQ9?tag=theverge02-20) ($50 off).

Like other portable batteries in Anker’s vast arsenal, the PowerHouse 521 is a handy way to keep your gadgets juiced when you don’t have access to a reliable power source (or any power, for that matter). It’s equipped with a built-in floodlight and a convenient LED display that allows you to monitor device output as well as a 256Wh capacity that ensures you’ll be able to charge your phone, laptop, tablet, and pretty much any other piece of tech you can throw at it (including small appliances). The port selection is as robust as its battery capacity, too, providing you with a pair of AC ports, a car outlet, two USB-A ports, and a single USB-C port that shares a total of 200W of power.

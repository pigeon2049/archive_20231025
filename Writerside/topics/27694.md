Al Jazeera said the wife, son and daughter of one of its correspondents in Gaza were killed on Wednesday night in an Israeli air strike that the Hamas-run enclave's health ministry said killed at least 25 people.

There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the strike, which Al Jazeera said hit an area in Gaza's central Nuseirat refugee camp.

Al Jazeera said the correspondent, Wael al-Dahdouh, had moved his family to Nuseirat from their home in northern Gaza after Israel warned residents to move south ahead of an expected Israeli ground assault against Hamas militants.

Other members of Dahdouh's family were killed in the strike, Al Jazeera said. The network did not accuse Israel of targeting his family.

Al Jazeera broadcast live footage of Dahdouh crying as he saw his family members laying lifeless in hospital.

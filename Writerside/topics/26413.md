California governor Gavin Newsom met Chinese president Xi Jinping on Wednesday to discuss climate change and other issues, Newsom told reporters.

Newsom said he had an opportunity to focus more deeply and substantively on climate change in the meeting with Xi, but also discussed Israel as well as the deadly drug fentanyl.

Newsom began his weeklong trip to China on Monday, visiting Hong Kong and Shenzhen before meeting senior officials in Beijing on Wednesday, including foreign minister Wang Yi.

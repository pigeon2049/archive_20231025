Apple Arcade, Apple News Plus, and the Apple One bundle are all going up in price, too. Apple Music, Apple Fitness Plus, and iCloud Plus are spared.

Apple is raising the prices of several of its services, including Apple TV Plus, Apple Arcade, Apple News Plus, and Apple One. Apple TV Plus is going from $6.99 per month to $9.99 per month, and Apple’s other services are seeing significant hikes, too. _MacRumors_ [first spotted](https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-services-price-increases/) the changes.

Instead of $4.99 per month, Apple Arcade will now cost $6.99 per month. Meanwhile, Apple News Plus is increasing from $9.99 per month to $12.99 per month. With all three services getting price increases, that means the Apple One bundle is going up as well.

Here’s a rundown of the new pricing across Apple One’s three tiers:

*   Individual: $19.95 (previously $16.95)
*   Family: $25.95 (previously $22.95)
*   Premier: $37.95 (previously $32.95)

Apple One’s Individual and Family plans offer access to TV Plus, Music, and Arcade. The Individual plan offers 50GB of iCloud Plus storage, while the Family plan allows for 200GB of storage shared among five people. The most expensive Premier plan adds Fitness Plus and News Plus subscriptions, along with 2TB of iCloud Plus storage.

Apple reports its fourth quarter earnings next Thursday. Revenue from subscription services like iCloud and Apple TV Plus has been an important, growing segment for the company, and today’s hikes will help to juice those numbers going forward. _The Verge_ reached out to Apple with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.

We last saw a [price hike across Apple’s services](https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/24/23420902/apple-tv-plus-music-price-increase) almost exactly one year ago from today, when it raised the prices of Apple Music, Apple TV Plus, and Apple One. It doesn’t look like Apple is raising the price of its Apple Music, Fitness Plus, or iCloud Plus subscriptions this time around, however.

Apple joins several other streaming services that have raised their prices this year, including [Netflix](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/18/23922319/netflix-q3-earnings-2023-price-hike-increase-basic-premium), [Hulu, Disney Plus](https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/9/23826500/disney-plus-hulu-no-ads-plan-price-increases), [Paramount Plus](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/27/23775370/paramount-plus-price-increase-showtime), [Discovery Plus](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/3/23901448/discovery-plus-price-increase-monthly-cost), and [Max](https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/12/23551990/hbo-max-ad-free-price-increase-15-99).

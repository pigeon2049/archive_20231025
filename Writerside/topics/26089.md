Qatar's prime minister said on Wednesday that the only way to reach a peaceful solution in Gaza is to keep communication channels open.

Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, who is also the minister of foreign affairs, added in a press conference with the Turkish foreign minister in Doha that Qatar will continue coordinating with Turkey and regional partners to de-escalate the crisis.

He added: "Qatar condemns the collective punishment policy" on Gaza.

Proton Pass allows you to share your streaming passwords or work logins using end-to-end encryption.

Proton’s password manager, Proton Pass, is [rolling out a new feature](https://proton.me/blog/password-sharing) that lets you share sign-ins using end-to-end encryption (E2EE). Instead of sharing a password over Gmail or a text, Proton will now let you safely give friends, family members, or co-workers access to things like streaming services, bank accounts, work logins, and more.

[Proton launched Proton Pass earlier this year](https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/20/23691097/proton-end-to-end-encrypted-password-manager-e2ee), allowing customers to store a vault of usernames, passwords, notes, bank cards, and email aliases using E2EE, which keeps sensitive information away from third parties, including Proton itself. But now, Proton is expanding its password manager to include secure sharing, giving you the ability to safely share this information with others.

You can share your passwords with others by selecting a vault or creating a new one within Proton Pass. Then select Share and enter the email address of the person you want to share your information with. From there, they’ll receive an invitation to access the vault. Proton will prompt them to create a Proton Pass account if they don’t have one already.

Proton notes that you can also change or revoke access to other users, giving you control over whether they can only view the items in your vault, edit them, or serve as an admin. That means you should easily be able to kick your ex out of your vault.

Secure sharing is free to all Proton Pass users. If you’re on a free plan, you can share your vaults with up to two other people. Meanwhile, those on Proton’s paid plan ([$4.99 / month](https://account.proton.me/pass/signup)) can create up to 20 vaults and share each of them with up to nine people. To compare, Bitwarden’s free plan only lets you share your vaults with one other person, and the free version of NordPass doesn’t let you share passwords at all. 1Password also has a password-sharing feature, but it doesn’t offer a free plan.

Powerful blasts near the area of Ukraine's Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plant damaged windows at the site overnight, but did not affect the plant's operations or its connection to the grid, the U.N. nuclear watchdog said on Wednesday.

The explosions temporarily cut power to some off-site radiation monitoring stations, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) added.

"The fact that numerous windows at the site were destroyed shows just how close it was. Next time, we may not be so fortunate,‚Äù IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said.

Apple raises prices of its subscription bundles

[Squawk on the Street](https://www.cnbc.com/squawk-on-the-street/)

[Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/) on Wednesday raised the prices for a number of its flagship services offerings, including Apple TV+, Arcade, and its bundled offering, Apple One. The move follows prior price [hikes in October](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/24/apple-raises-prices-on-apple-tv-and-apple-music.html) 2022.

Apple TV+ will now cost $9.99 a month, up from $6.99. The price increase comes after Apple upped the price in 2022 from $4.99. The annual package will now cost $99, up from $69.

[Apple One](https://www.apple.com/apple-one/), the bundle package used by many families to access Apple's services at a lower price will also increase, with the top end Premier package now costing $37.95 a month.

Apple's Arcade and News+ monthly prices are also increasing, to $6.99 and $12.99 respectively.

All these products form a part of Apple's services business. The segment generated $21.21 billion in revenue during Apple's fiscal third quarter, making it Apple's second largest business behind the iPhone, which generated $39.76 billion during the same time period.

The business is extremely profitable, and important for investors because it signals how Apple is monetizing its active base of 2 billion devices by selling them subscriptions, streaming TV, warranties, advertising, payment services, and other products included in the category.

The price increases [mirror](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/09/disney-to-raise-disney-price-for-ad-free-plan-in-september.html) those made by [other major](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/18/netflix-nflx-earnings-q3-2023.html) media players, including [Disney](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DIS/) and [Netflix](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NFLX/).

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on when the changes would roll out to existing customers.

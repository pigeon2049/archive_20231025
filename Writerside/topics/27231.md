Cramer’s Stop Trading: Nvidia

[Squawk on the Street](https://www.cnbc.com/squawk-on-the-street/)

The latest [U.S. restrictions on AI chip sales in China](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/24/where-we-stand-on-nvidias-latest-china-update-and-its-potential-foray-into-a-new-processor-market.html) won't dethrone [Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/) (NVDA) as the world's most valuable semiconductor company, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Wednesday.

Instead, this spells trouble for rivals [Advanced Micro Devices](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMD/) (AMD) and [Intel](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/INTC/) (INTC).

The impact of the updated [export controls](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/17/us-bans-export-of-more-ai-chips-including-nvidia-h800-to-china.html) will heat up competition in the U.S. market further, Cramer said on "Squawk on the Street."

Nvidia has already grabbed lots of market share by providing the likes of [Alphabet](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/) (GOOGL) and [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/) (MSFT) with chips crucial to running their artificial intelligence efforts, he added.

Shares of Nvidia, up a whopping 200% year-to-date, edged lower after Wednesday's opening.

Nvidia, Alphabet and Microsoft are stock holdings in [Jim's Charitable Trust](https://www.cnbc.com/investingclub/charitable-trust/?__source=InvestingClub%7Corganic%7Consite%7Cinvestingclubsamplearticle&amp;tpcc=InvestingClub%7Corganic%7Consite%7Cinvestingclubsamplearticle), the portfolio used by the CNBC Investing Club.

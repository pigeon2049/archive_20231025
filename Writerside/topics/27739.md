As the war in Israel continues, Telegram has cut off the channels Hamas uses to communicate, but only for Android users.

Social messaging platform Telegram has blocked channels used by Hamas, though only on Android phones. [According to CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/25/israel-hamas-telegram-removes-hamas-channels-on-android.html), two channels — hamas\_com and al-Qassam brigades — were cut off for Android users, though other channels the group uses, like Gaza Now, are still accessible.

Telegram blamed the blocks on Google’s app store guidelines, according to a [story in _The Jerusalem Post_](https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-769852). Users reportedly see an error saying the channels can’t be viewed on “Telegram apps downloaded from the Google Play Store,” implying that the ban doesn’t extend to the app when it’s downloaded from elsewhere or used on another operating system.

[Both Meta](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23915742/meta-israel-hamas-content-moderation-arabic-hebrew-speakers) and [X (formerly Twitter) have said](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/12/23914020/x-twitter-israel-hamas-war-disinformation-misinformation-european-union-dsa-commissioner) they’ve taken action to block Hamas-linked accounts and limit the spread of misinformation about the war on their platforms. But Telegram usually has a light touch when it comes to moderation and has opposed removing channels unless its hand is forced. _The Verge_ has reached out to both Telegram and Google about the blocked channels.

[Telegram CEO Pavel Durov wrote](https://t.me/durov/230) that he was hesitant to shut down Hamas-used channels in a post on October 13th, saying that “tackling war-related coverage is seldom obvious” and writing that Hamas had used Telegram a few days prior to warn civilians to evacuate an area before they attacked it.

But Hamas also uses Telegram to spread videos of its attacks, [according to Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/10/18/israel/palestine-videos-hamas-led-attacks-verified), and as CNBC points out in its report today, one of the channels Telegram has blocked is used by Hamas’ military wing.

Telegram is popular for its lax moderation and encryption. [CNN reported](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/16/tech/hamas-telegram/index.html) last week that the al-Qassam brigades channel’s followers tripled after its attack on Israel. The report adds that many of those followers may not support Hamas but that the channel’s growth increases the odds of the group’s messages spreading [beyond Telegram itself](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/telegram-fueling-israel-hamas-war-misinformation-1234854300/). A former Meta moderation leader told CNN that Hamas’ approach on Telegram is “really the model we saw with ISIS.”

With the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA) in force, governments in the bloc have enforcement power over most social media companies’ content moderation. That’s visible in the EU’s dealings with [Meta](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/11/23912993/meta-israel-hamas-european-commission-digital-services-act-dsa) and [X](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/10/23911686/eu-elon-musk-x-disinformation-digital-services-act-hamas-israel), which both received letters from EU Commissioner Thierry Breton demanding they step up their [moderation amid the war](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/19/23924409/israel-hamas-war-crisis-tech-companies).

Telegram isn’t listed as a “very large online platform” under the DSA, but governments in the region have successfully pressured the platform to take action. In February 2022, Telegram blocked [more than 60 channels in Germany](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/more-than-60-telegram-channels-blocked-germany-newspaper-2022-02-11/#:~:text=BERLIN%2C%20Feb%2011%20(Reuters),a%20source%20for%20the%20information) when the government threatened to block it nationwide over covid misinformation. It also [banned Russian state media](https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-rt-media-telegram-ukraine/) the same year after EU pressure related to the invasion of Ukraine.

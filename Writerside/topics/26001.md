Three-letter domain names are highly favored by businesses for several reasons:

1\. Rarity: There are 17,576 possible combinations for three-letter domain names (26\*26\*26), making them scarcer compared to four-letter combinations, which have 456,976 possibilities. The scarcity contributes to their higher value.

2\. Memorability: Due to their shorter length, three-letter domain names are easier for people to remember. They are also meaningful, facilitating brand promotion and marketing efforts both domestically and internationally. These concise domain names can be easily printed on items like business cards and advertisements, simplifying the user experience when entering a web address.

3\. Commercial Value: Three-letter combinations often relate to various industries, companies, or brands. Therefore, owning a relevant three-letter domain name increases a brand's commercial value and professional image.

Three-letter domain names are indeed considered treasure troves in the domain world, and their acquisition by businesses further underscores their value. Worldwide, there is almost a consensus on the value of three-letter domain names, with many Fortune 500 companies using them, such as MAC.com (Apple), AWS.com (Amazon), BYD.com (BYD), CCB.COM (China Construction Bank), BMW.COM (BMW), JNJ.COM (Johnson & Johnson), UPS.COM (UPS), and IBM.COM (IBM), among others.

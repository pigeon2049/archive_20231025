The Indonesian president's son and vice-presidential hopeful, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, said on Wednesday if his ticket with Defence Minister Prabowo Subianto is voted into office they would provide loans for digital start-ups and continue to develop the mineral processing industry and a green economy.

Gibran is the running mate of Defence Minister Prabowo Subianto in next year's presidential election. The pair are set to register as candidates at the election commission later on Wednesday.

Prabowo has been leading in opinion surveys against two other contenders Ganjar Pranowo and Anies Baswedan.

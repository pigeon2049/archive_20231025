The useCallback hook in React is used to memoize a callback function, preventing it from being recreated on every render. Memoization is a technique that stores the results of a function call and retrieves them from a cache, improving performance. By using useCallback, developers can optimize their React apps by avoiding unnecessary re-renders of components. The hook is especially useful when passing functions as props to child components or when working with functions that rely on external data or state.
